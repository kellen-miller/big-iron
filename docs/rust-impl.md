# Big Iron: Rust-Based Architectural Patterns for a Distributed Hyperkernel

## Overview of a Distributed Hyperkernel (Big Iron)

Big Iron refers to a **distributed hyperkernel** design that makes a cluster of physical nodes appear as a single large
Linux system (a single system image). In this architecture, a lightweight hypervisor layer runs on each node and *
*federates CPUs, memory, and I/O** across machines, creating one virtual machine spanning all nodes. The goal is to
combine the resources of many servers into one “big iron” environment with a unified Linux kernel, without requiring
modifications to the OS or applications. This concept is exemplified by systems like TidalScale’s **HyperKernel**, which
treats a cluster’s aggregate memory and CPUs as one large pool and uses clever scheduling and memory management to
maintain the illusion of a single big NUMA
machine ([The Dream Of Software Only Shared Memory Clusters](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/10/25/dream-software-shared-memory-clusters/#:~:text=The%20core%20of%20the%20TidalScale,in%20server%20hardware%20these%20days)).

Implementing such a hyperkernel in Rust leverages Rust’s strengths in **safety and concurrency** for low-level systems.
Key challenges include low-level hypervisor control (to create and run VMs on each node), distributed virtual memory
management (making remote memory accessible and coherent cluster-wide), virtual CPU (vCPU) scheduling and migration
across nodes, and high-performance networking to interconnect nodes. This document explores existing Rust-based
implementations and design patterns relevant to these challenges, focusing on how Rust crates and practices can be used
to build a Big Iron hyperkernel with strong safety and performance guarantees.

## Low-Level Hypervisor Control in Rust

Building a hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) in Rust has become practical with projects like **rust-vmm**.
Rust-vmm is a community effort that provides reusable virtualization components (crates) for building custom VMMs and
hypervisors. For example, Amazon’s **Firecracker** VMM and Intel/Cloud Hypervisor are built on rust-vmm components.
These crates allow Rust to interface with hardware virtualization features (like Intel VT-x/EPT via KVM) while
preserving memory safety. Key rust-vmm crates include:

- **`kvm-ioctls`** – Safe wrappers for Linux KVM ioctls, used to create VMs, vCPUs, and configure virtualization
  features. This crate wraps low-level `unsafe` syscalls into high-level Rust interfaces. For example, it provides
  methods to create a VM file descriptor, set CPU registers, and run the vCPU, encapsulating the `ioctl` calls needed to
  interact with `/dev/kvm`. The unsafe operations (ioctl calls and shared memory mappings) are contained within this
  crate’s implementation, exposing a safe API.
- **`kvm-bindings`** – Auto-generated Rust bindings to KVM’s ioctl interface and data structures. It defines the structs
  and constants (e.g. KVM data types for CPU registers, memory regions, etc.) that mirror the C interface, enabling
  rust-vmm crates to invoke KVM functionality.
- **`vm-memory`** – Abstraction for the guest’s physical memory space. It provides traits like `GuestMemory` to manage
  guest memory regions safely. Using these traits, VM memory consumers (e.g. vCPU emulation or virtual devices) can
  interact with guest memory without knowing how it’s backed (file, anonymous mem, hugepages, etc.). This decoupling is
  important for Big Iron: one could implement a custom **guest memory backend** that spans multiple nodes (using network
  paging under the hood) while still conforming to the `vm-memory` API for safety.
- **`event-manager`** – An event loop for handling I/O events (based on `epoll`), enabling asynchronous device emulation
  and timers. This crate allows registration of event handlers (for file descriptors, timers, etc.) and dispatches
  events in the VMM’s main thread. A distributed hyperkernel can use it to handle network socket events (for incoming
  page requests or vCPU migrations) and other asynchronous tasks without busy-waiting.
- **`vm-superio`** – Emulated **super I/O** devices like serial ports, i8042 (keyboard controller), RTC, etc.,
  implemented in Rust. Big Iron might use this to provide a basic console and necessary stub devices to the unified
  guest OS.
- **`vmm-sys-util`** – Utility library for low-level OS interactions (safe wrappers for memory-mapped I/O, signal
  handling, file descriptor operations, etc.). This helps with tasks like allocating hugepages, handling CPU affinities,
  or creating event file descriptors in a safe manner.

A Rust VMM typically composes these components into a cohesive module. For example, the rust-vmm reference VMM defines a
`VMM` struct that ties together KVM, memory, vCPUs, and devices. The **Firecracker** microVM is structured with a
KVM-based VMM core plus a minimalist device model, deliberately excluding unnecessary devices to reduce attack surface.
Each microVM in Firecracker has one or more vCPU threads and a main thread for I/O, using epoll for event handling.
Firecracker’s design demonstrates how a small, well-audited code base in Rust can safely manage virtualization tasks
with low overhead. Cloud Hypervisor similarly uses multiple threads (vCPUs on their own threads, an I/O thread, etc.)
and relies on rust-vmm crates for memory and KVM access, showing that Rust’s strong ownership model can coexist with the
shared-memory concurrency of a hypervisor.

**Safety practices:** In these Rust hypervisors, `unsafe` code is used only where absolutely necessary (e.g., FFI calls
to KVM ioctls or mapping guest memory). By centralizing unsafe operations in specific modules, they minimize risk.
Memory-mapped I/O regions or guest RAM are accessed via Rust slices or volatile pointers wrapped by safe APIs, ensuring
that buffer overruns or type misinterpretations are less likely than in C. Additionally, Rust’s compile-time checks
prevent data races on shared data structures (unless explicitly wrapped in atomics or locks), which is crucial when
multiple vCPUs and I/O threads operate in parallel.

## Memory Management and Distributed Shared Memory

One of the hardest parts of a distributed hyperkernel is making **distributed memory** act like a single contiguous RAM
to the guest OS. Each physical node has its local RAM, but the guest Linux kernel should see a unified address space
that transparently spans nodes. This essentially requires implementing a form of **Distributed Shared Memory (DSM)** at
the hypervisor level, with strong coherence (all nodes see a consistent memory state) and reasonable performance.

**Guest memory virtualization:** On a single-node VMM, guest physical memory is typically allocated as a contiguous
block or set of regions on the host, and registered with KVM (so the hypervisor knows how to translate guest PFNs to
host memory). In Rust, the `vm-memory` crate’s `GuestMemoryMmap` implementation can map a file or anonymous memory to
guest addresses, providing methods to read/write guest memory safely. This crate ensures that even though guest memory
is ultimately a raw pointer mapping, accesses go through safe Rust interfaces (with bounds checking, etc.). For Big
Iron, one could extend this concept: for example, instead of a simple mmap to a local file, a custom **GuestMemory**
implementation could lazily fetch pages from other nodes. This might use Linux’s userfaultfd mechanism or explicit
network paging: if the guest tries to access a page not currently resident locally, an event (VM exit or page fault) is
triggered, and the hyperkernel software fetches the page from whichever node currently holds it.

**Distributed Shared Memory approach:** TidalScale’s HyperKernel (though implemented in C/C++) provides a model for how
to manage memory across nodes. It treats the aggregate memory of all nodes as a big pool and implements an on-demand
page migration mechanism. In effect, each node’s memory acts as a cache of the “global” memory. In HyperKernel’s design,
**the entire cluster’s memory behaves like a giant last-level cache (L4)** for the CPUs. When a vCPU on Node A accesses
a memory page that currently “lives” on Node B, the hyperkernel must decide whether to fetch the page or migrate the
vCPU to the data. It uses a cost model: if the access is read-only or infrequent, it might be cheaper to copy the page
over the network to Node A; if the page is part of a heavily used working set on Node B, it may be better to move the
vCPU from A to B to execute near that memory. This strategy reduces network traffic by keeping computation near data
when possible, analogous to NUMA optimizations.

To implement DSM in Rust, the hyperkernel on each node would maintain a **memory directory or table** indicating which
node has each page of guest “physical” memory. On modern CPUs with virtualization (Intel EPT or AMD NPT), the hypervisor
can use second-level page tables to intercept guest memory accesses. In practice, each node’s KVM will have a memory
slot registered for all guest memory, but pages not present locally could be marked not-present or read-only so that any
access causes a trap (VM exit). The hyperkernel then handles the fault: it can pause the vCPU, send a message to the
node that owns the page (or a cluster memory service) to get the latest data, install that page into local memory,
update page tables, and resume the vCPU. Alternatively, as noted, the hyperkernel might **migrate the vCPU’s execution**
to the node where the page resides (more on that in the next section). In either case, proper synchronization is
required so that no two nodes treat the same page as writable at the same time (to maintain strict coherence). This
typically means only one “owner” for each writable page, or using a **copy-on-write (COW)** approach for pages
duplicated as read-only copies.

Strong consistency can be achieved by invalidating or revoking pages when they're written. For instance, if Node A has a
copy of a page for read caching and Node B now wants to write to that page, the hyperkernel must invalidate A’s copy (
and flush any TLB entries) before allowing B to proceed with the write. The HyperKernel approach indeed ensures *memory
is always strongly cache-coherent across the cluster*, allowing multiple copies of read-only pages but invalidating
others on a write. Implementing this in Rust would involve careful use of synchronization primitives and possibly memory
barriers. For example, marking a page copy invalid might involve an atomic flag or sequence number per page that all
nodes check or update under lock. Rust’s memory model (via `std::sync::atomic` with `Ordering::SeqCst` or appropriate
fences) can be used to enforce ordering of memory operations across threads. However, coherence across separate machines
relies on protocol messages – essentially, distributed locking or invalidation messages.

Safety considerations in DSM: Managing memory across nodes is inherently tricky and likely involves some `unsafe` code
when manipulating page tables or handling raw pointers. The hyperkernel might use Rust’s ability to call foreign
functions (e.g., to change KVM memory mappings or to perform cache flush ioctl operations). It should carefully separate
policy from mechanism: high-level logic (when to migrate a page or CPU) can be written in safe Rust, while low-level
hooks into KVM or network DMA might use unsafe blocks. Memory buffers for network transfer of pages can be managed with
Rust slices or `Vec<u8>` to benefit from bounds checking. Also, using Rust’s ownership can help ensure that a page’s
data is not mutated from two places at once – for example, when a page is in transit between nodes, you could
encapsulate it in a message that moves ownership, preventing any code from accessing the stale local copy until it’s
updated.

Additionally, crate-level support: If using Linux, one could leverage the **userfaultfd** mechanism via a Rust binding
to handle page faults in user space. While not specific to Rust, crates like `userfaultfd-rs` (if available) or direct
FFI calls can allow a process to intercept page faults on a memory range and fulfill them manually, which is essentially
how one could implement on-demand paging from remote nodes. This technique was used in some VM live migration and DSM
systems. Using it in Rust, the hyperkernel could register the guest memory range and when a missing page is accessed, a
user-space handler sends a network request and inserts the page on arrival.

In summary, Rust can implement distributed memory management by combining hardware virtualization features (KVM’s EPT
for trapping memory accesses) with high-level logic (written in safe Rust) to fetch/migrate memory. The design should
minimize network latency effects by smart placement of computation, as HyperKernel does with its dynamic cost-based
decisions. **Machine learning** or adaptive algorithms can assist in predicting which pages or computations to move –
for example, tracking recent access patterns to improve locality – and such algorithms can be implemented in Rust and
run concurrently on each node’s hyperkernel instance.

## Virtual CPU Scheduling and Migration

In a Big Iron system, virtual CPUs (vCPUs) of the single unified VM are actually distributed across nodes. Each physical
node may run a subset of the VM’s vCPUs on its hardware cores (via KVM threads). The challenge is that a vCPU might need
to access memory or devices that are currently homed on another node. When that happens, the hyperkernel must decide
whether to **migrate the vCPU thread to the data** or bring the data to the vCPU. This is a unique scheduling problem at
the cluster level.

**Local scheduling:** Within each node, scheduling vCPUs is similar to a normal hypervisor – e.g., binding each vCPU
thread to a physical core or using the host OS scheduler. Rust can leverage standard thread affinity controls (via
`libc` or `nix` crates) to pin vCPU threads. The rust-vmm `vmm` design typically dedicates one host thread per vCPU for
simplicity and performance isolation. This pattern would likely continue in a hyperkernel: if the unified VM has N
vCPUs, and M physical nodes, you might start N threads distributed among the nodes (roughly N/M per node if evenly
distributed). Each thread issues `KVM_RUN` on its vCPU in a loop, handling VM exits (e.g., I/O, page faults) when they
occur. Rust’s strong typing helps here by associating each vCPU thread with its resources (like a struct containing its
KVM vCPU fd, local memory map, etc.), avoiding mix-ups.

**vCPU migration:** The novel part is moving a running vCPU from one node to another. This entails serializing the
vCPU’s state (CPU registers, program counter, and potentially some cached state like local APIC or CPU flags) and
transferring it to another machine’s hypervisor, then resuming it there. Modern virtualization makes this feasible:
hardware virtualization extensions allow capturing a vCPU’s full state quickly. For instance, KVM provides ioctls to get
the vCPU’s registers and FPU state, which can be done in a few microseconds. HyperKernel exploits this, noting that *
*VT-x and VT-d provide capabilities to extract a vCPU from one host and inject it into another very quickly**. In
practice, a migration might work like this in Rust:

- The hyperkernel decides to move vCPU X from Node A to Node B (perhaps because vCPU X is trying to access a large set
  of pages on Node B). On Node A, the vCPU thread is stopped (KVM run returns on a specific signal or request).
- Node A’s hyperkernel code collects the CPU state via `kvm-ioctls` (e.g., calls to `get_regs`, `get_sregs`, etc. from
  the KVM vCPU file descriptor). This yields structs (defined in `kvm-bindings`) containing register values.
- That state data is sent over the network to Node B (for efficiency, possibly in a single **Jumbo Ethernet frame** if
  using raw Ethernet as HyperKernel does).
- Node B’s hyperkernel creates a new vCPU (or reuses an already allocated slot for vCPU X) in its KVM instance if not
  already present, and sets the received register state via the corresponding `set_regs` calls.
- Node B then resumes the vCPU thread, now running on Node B’s hardware. From the guest OS’s perspective, the vCPU
  simply experienced a slight pause (the execution context is preserved perfectly), and now memory accesses that were
  local to Node B are satisfied with no network penalty because the vCPU moved to the memory.

This kind of *vCPU hot-migration* is essentially what TidalScale’s HyperKernel does: “mobilizing the CPU is the secret
sauce” according to their engineers. By moving threads instead of large chunks of memory, the hyperkernel can keep most
memory accesses local. The network cost is paid once to move the vCPU, rather than repeatedly for each memory access in
a loop.

**Coordination and state:** No single node controls all scheduling – in fact, HyperKernel is designed with **no master
node and no shared global state** among the hyperkernels. Each node’s hyperkernel makes local decisions, presumably
communicating with peers as needed. This distributed approach avoids a single point of failure, but it means vCPU
migration decisions might be made collaboratively or via some consensus. A possible implementation is to have a
lightweight **distributed scheduler**: for example, if Node A faults on a page from Node B, Node A can send a request to
Node B asking to either send the page or receive the vCPU. Node B might measure its own load or locality and respond
with a suggestion. Simple policies (like always move the vCPU if the working set on B is above a threshold) could be
used initially, with more advanced heuristic or machine learning-based optimizations refining it over time.

From a Rust concurrency perspective, migrating a vCPU involves careful locking of the vCPU state during transfer. The
hyperkernel must ensure the vCPU’s state is not modified (e.g., by an interrupt) mid-transfer. Likely, one would pause
the vCPU (maybe via KVM’s `KVM_INTERRUPT` ioctl or sending it an IPI if running in guest context) and mark it as
migrating. Using Rust, this could be modeled by a state enum for each vCPU (Running, Paused, Migrating, etc.), possibly
protected by a Mutex or atomic flags to coordinate between the thread and management code. Once safely stopped, the
state data (which is just a bunch of integers) can be packaged. The actual data is not huge (register state on x86 is on
the order of a few hundred bytes), so serialization can be as simple as writing the structs to a byte buffer. Rust’s
standard library or `bincode`/`serde` can handle serialization, but given versioning concerns, something like
Firecracker’s `versionize` framework could be repurposed to ensure compatibility of vCPU state across hyperkernel
versions (especially if the hyperkernel evolves, or if different CPU types are in use across nodes).

**Scheduling policies:** Once vCPUs can move freely, the system resembles a distributed scheduler. Rust’s strengths in
building complex, concurrent state machines shine here. We might leverage an async runtime or message-passing model to
handle coordination messages: for example, each node runs an async task listening for “migrate vCPU” or “send page”
requests from others (this could be implemented with **Tokio** streams or simply an epoll-managed socket). The decision
logic can be unit-tested as a pure Rust module (input: access patterns, output: move or copy decision), isolated from
the unsafe parts. Over time, one could incorporate adaptive algorithms — e.g., reinforcement learning to decide
migrations — in safe Rust. The system also has to handle edge cases like *downtime during migration* (the window where a
vCPU is paused should be as brief as possible), and failures (if a node dies, other nodes should detect it and possibly
restart its vCPUs elsewhere, leveraging the fact that the state of all vCPUs and pages are virtual and mobile).

Notably, **modern hardware assist** eases some tasks: invalidating remote TLBs or ensuring memory order across
migrations can rely on inter-processor interrupts and well-defined memory ordering. Intel guarantees a strong memory
model (store ordering) across coherence domains, so if the hyperkernel properly invalidates pages on one node before
allowing writes on another, consistency is maintained. Rust doesn’t change this low-level reality, but writing the code
in Rust can help ensure we don’t forget an edge case: for example, by encapsulating “ownership” of a memory page in a
Rust struct that must be moved when a page migrates, we can embed invariants (like “only one mutable owner at a time”)
enforced by the type system.

## High-Performance Networking for Node Interconnect

The performance of a Big Iron hyperkernel heavily depends on the network linking the physical nodes. All the magic of
remote paging and vCPU migration ultimately involves sending data over the network. Thus, a high-throughput, low-latency
communication mechanism is critical. In Rust, there are several avenues to implement the cluster interconnect:

- **Standard Linux Networking (sockets)**: The simplest route is to use the kernel’s TCP/IP or UDP for communication
  between hyperkernels. Rust’s async networking with **Tokio** can efficiently handle many concurrent connections or
  requests. Tokio provides non-blocking sockets, event-driven futures, and integration with the OS networking stack.
  This is convenient and leverages decades of TCP/IP optimizations. HyperKernel itself reportedly just uses raw Ethernet
  frames over a standard 10 GbE network and finds that this link is not fully taxed by their workload. They achieved
  acceptable latency using normal TCP/IP (with some optimization), avoiding the need for exotic networking. Using Tokio
  or even standard threads with blocking sockets in Rust could suffice if 10–100 Gbps networks are available. The code
  structure might involve an async task for listening to incoming requests (e.g., page fault or vCPU state transfers)
  and a thread-safe queue to dispatch responses. If using TCP, reliability is handled by the protocol; if using UDP or
  raw Ethernet, the hyperkernel might implement its own simple reliability/ack scheme for critical transfers like page
  data.

- **User-space Networking (DPDK)**: For maximum packet rate and predictable latency, bypassing the kernel with
  frameworks like **DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit)** is an option. Rust does not have DPDK in std, but projects like
  **Capsule** provide safe abstractions over DPDK in Rust. Capsule and the underlying NetBricks research show that you
  can achieve near line-rate packet processing in Rust, by dedicating CPU cores to polling network queues and using
  zero-copy buffers. A hyperkernel could use DPDK to treat the cluster interconnect like a **system bus** (as Ike Nassi
  described, the private interconnect is treated as if it were a backplane bus). With DPDK, one could send 64B
  cache-line sized packets extremely fast between nodes, which might be useful for sending invalidation messages or
  small control signals. The bulk data (page migrations) could use larger frames or even a DPDK-driven RDMA if hardware
  permits. The downside is significant complexity and the need for `unsafe` (DPDK is in C and involves shared memory
  pools, etc.). Capsule mitigates some of this by providing a Rust API for packet manipulation that is memory-safe and
  thread-safe. If ultra-low latency is required (for example, scaling to many nodes where network congestion could
  occur), investing in a user-space network stack may be justified.

- **Custom network stack (smoltcp or no-std)**: In some hyperkernel designs, one might run without a full Linux OS on
  the node, essentially making the hyperkernel itself the host OS. In that scenario, a lightweight TCP/IP stack like *
  *smoltcp** (a no_std embeddable stack written in Rust) can be used. Smoltcp allows sending and receiving packets
  directly via a device driver, all in Rust, and is designed for simplicity and reliability. It could be integrated with
  a bare-metal NIC driver (written in Rust or using passthrough with VT-d). However, implementing a full TCP/IP might be
  unnecessary overhead if the cluster is in a controlled environment – one could design a custom protocol for the
  hyperkernel to exchange data (for example, a simple RPC over UDP or raw Ethernet frames where each message type is
  well-defined). Rust’s enum types and serialization libraries make it straightforward to define such protocols. For
  instance, an enum
  `HyperMessage { PageRequest(u64 addr), PageData(u64 addr, [u8; 4096]), VcpuStateTransfer(State), ... }` can define all
  message types, which can then be serialized either manually or with something like `bincode`.

- **RDMA and advanced networking**: If the cluster has RDMA-capable NICs (InfiniBand or RoCE), the hyperkernel could
  exploit Remote Direct Memory Access to pull and push memory with minimal CPU involvement. Rust bindings like
  `rust-ibverbs` exist to use RDMA verbs. This would allow one node to directly write to another node’s memory over the
  network, which is essentially ideal for implementing a distributed shared memory (one node’s page fault handler could
  RDMA-read the page from the owner’s memory). RDMA can drastically reduce latency and CPU overhead for large transfers,
  although it introduces its own complexity (managing queue pairs, registration of memory regions, etc.). A Big Iron
  hyperkernel in Rust could use RDMA to make remote memory access closer to hardware speed, treating the network like an
  extension of the memory bus.

The networking code has to be **highly concurrent**. Many vCPUs might be triggering memory operations simultaneously
across nodes. Rust’s async facilities or multi-threading with lock-free structures (like using **crossbeam** channels or
ringbuffers) can help process many network events in parallel. For example, one could dedicate a thread to purely handle
network I/O (using a tight DPDK poll loop or epoll loop) and then hand off messages to worker threads for processing (
like fetching a page from local disk if needed or integrating a received page into the memory map). Because Rust
prevents data races, one can safely share references to a global page table or state directory between these workers
using atomic or locked data structures. When performance is critical, one might lean on **message passing** (each
subsystem runs independently and communicates via channels) to avoid large mutexes. This model – essentially an actor
model – aligns with the design of many Rust systems. In fact, the multi-node nature of Big Iron inherently encourages
thinking in terms of message passing (since everything crossing the network is a message). Extending that mindset
internally (treat each vCPU or each major component as an actor) can result in a clean, deadlock-free design.

**Example networking pattern:** The hyperkernel could assign each node a unique ID and maintain a TCP connection (or
RDMA QP) to every other node. When Node A needs a page from Node B, it sends a message over that connection and blocks
the vCPU (or puts it to sleep). Node B’s networking task receives the request, quickly marshals the page from memory (
since Rust can directly slice the guest memory array if it’s a contiguous `Vec<u8>` or similar, zero-copy) and sends it.
Node A receives it and unblocks the vCPU. This round trip can be on the order of tens of microseconds on a 10 GbE
network for a 4KB page. If instead the decision was to move the vCPU, a similar exchange happens with the state data.
The latency in either case needs to be much smaller than typical disk I/O (which it is) so that the unified system still
feels responsive. Indeed, a well-tuned hyperkernel will ensure that the **cost of remote memory access or vCPU migration
is comparable to, or less than, the cost of a page fault to disk**, making the large cluster appear like a single
large (albeit NUMA) machine.

## Concurrency Models and Safety Practices in Rust Systems

Rust is particularly attractive for building a hyperkernel because it enables low-level control with high-level safety
guarantees. **Memory safety** and **concurrency safety** are paramount in a system that will manage terabytes of memory
and dozens of threads across a cluster.

**Concurrency model:** A distributed hyperkernel can employ a mix of **multithreading and async message passing**. For
example, each vCPU runs in its own thread (to leverage parallelism on multiple cores), which is a simple model that maps
well to hardware and is used by many VMMs. Meanwhile, I/O or coordination tasks might use an asynchronous model (e.g.,
one thread running an event loop with many socket futures). Rust allows these to coexist: one can use standard threads
with `std::sync::mpsc` or `crossbeam` channels to communicate, or use an async runtime for certain components and spawn
dedicated threads for others. The choice often boils down to performance considerations: **message passing** can
minimize locking (each thread mostly works on its own data and communicates via channels) at the cost of some context
switching, whereas **shared-state with locking** might achieve lower latency for certain tightly-coupled operations but
risks contention. Rust encourages message passing by making ownership transfer easy (sending values through channels
moves ownership, preventing concurrent access bugs).

In the hyperkernel context, critical shared structures (like the global page table that tracks page ownership, or a
directory of where each vCPU is currently running) may need synchronization. Rust’s `RwLock` or `Mutex` can serialize
access, but in a highly parallel cluster manager, a more lock-free or partitioned approach is desirable. One could shard
the responsibility (each node manages a subset of pages as owner, so there's no single global lock for all memory) –
this is already implied by “no shared state in the hyperkernel, management is distributed”. Within each node, data
structures like a local cache of remote pages might use atomics for reference counts (with `Ordering::SeqCst` to ensure
changes propagate), and employ event-driven updates (e.g., when a page ownership changes, send messages rather than
having all nodes check a lock).

**Use of `unsafe` and memory barriers:** Systems programming in Rust often requires some unsafe code, but the idea is to
contain it. For instance, interacting with device memory or special CPU instructions (like flushing TLBs or memory
barriers) may require `asm!` or FFI calls. The hyperkernel could use inline assembly for things like invalidating caches
or ensuring memory ordering between nodes if needed (on x86, this might be as simple as an SFENCE or MFENCE instruction,
which can be invoked via `core::arch::x86_64::_mm_mfence()` or an asm block). Proper use of memory barriers is crucial
in a distributed setting to avoid subtle race conditions (e.g., Node A must not send a “page is free” message before all
its cores have truly stopped accessing that page; a memory fence can help enforce this).

Rust’s type system can model certain invariants to reduce reliance on barriers. For example, one could represent the
state of a page by a Rust enum (Available, OwnedBy(NodeId), Shared(ReadOnly, holders: Vec<NodeId>), etc.). Transitions
between these states would be done in a single-threaded context or with a lock, simplifying reasoning. When sending
messages, using Rust’s ownership means you’re often moving data out of one context into another, which acts as a sort of
*synchronization* itself (you can’t accidentally have two owners unless you intentionally use `Arc`). Where low-level
atomic operations are needed (like reference counts for how many nodes have a copy of a page), Rust offers `AtomicUsize`
and similar, which are explicit about the memory ordering of operations. This makes it clear where you're assuming
things about timing and visibility of memory changes.

**Code organization and modules:** A likely architecture for a Rust hyperkernel is to split it into modules by concern:

- A **KVM interface module** (wrapping kvm-ioctls usage, handling VM creation, vCPU launching, etc.).
- A **memory manager module** (responsible for tracking distributed pages, interfacing with vm-memory crate, and
  handling page faults or migrations).
- A **scheduler module** (deciding vCPU placement, initiating migrations, load balancing between nodes).
- A **networking module** (abstracting whether we use TCP, UDP, RDMA, etc., and providing a unified way to send messages
  or remote procedure calls to other hyperkernels).
- A **device proxy or I/O module** (since the unified VM may have virtual devices, possibly one node could act as the
  I/O coordinator – e.g., all disk I/O is handled by the node that has the physical disk and results are sent to others.
  This is another aspect: handling I/O in a distributed VM, which could be a document of its own. Rust could simplify
  writing a network RAID or distributed disk service if needed).

By separating these concerns, each module can use the most appropriate concurrency model. For example, the networking
module might be fully asynchronous, using Tokio to await message events, while the memory manager might be mostly
synchronous but use background threads for prefetching pages (speculatively fetching pages that it predicts will be
needed soon, to hide latency). Rust’s powerful async/await feature can make it straightforward to express things like
“when a page fault happens, send a request, then suspend this task until the data arrives” rather than blocking an
entire thread.

**Existing Rust systems as inspiration:** The use of Rust in performance-critical systems is already proven. Firecracker
and Cloud Hypervisor show that even virtualization, traditionally done in C (like QEMU, Xen, etc.), can be done in Rust
with fewer security issues. An ACM study introduced a prototype **Rust-based KVM hypervisor core** and highlighted that
Rust’s safety features can eliminate certain classes of vulnerabilities while maintaining
performance ([Securing a Multiprocessor KVM Hypervisor with Rust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3698038.3698562#:~:text=This%20work%20explores%20building%20on,core%20to%20protect%20virtual)).
Beyond hypervisors, Rust is used in OS projects like Redox and Theseus. Theseus OS in particular is a research OS that
leverages Rust’s ownership to manage memory without a traditional MMU and explores live evolution of software
components. While Theseus is not distributed, its intra-kernel safety and **intralingual design** (treating OS types and
resources in a Rust-centric way) could influence Big Iron’s design by encouraging more of the system’s logic to be
checked at compile time (for example, avoiding raw pointers for anything that can be wrapped in a safer abstraction).

Rust’s **zero-cost abstractions** mean we can introduce layers of structure (traits, modules, message types) with little
or no runtime overhead, which is ideal for a project as complex as a distributed hyperkernel. We can have well-defined
interfaces (traits) for things like “PageStore” (something that can fetch or store a memory page) and implement one for
local RAM and one for remote nodes. The Rust compiler will inline and optimize away the abstraction when possible (
especially with generics), so performance stays high.

Finally, **testing and verification**: A huge benefit of implementing in Rust is the ability to test components in
isolation. For example, one could simulate the memory manager’s policy with a unit test or in a single-process model (
with a fake “network” that is just a function call) to ensure correctness, then trust that logic when deployed on real
hardware. Rust’s safety and the presence of tools like `loom` (a framework for testing concurrent code by exploring
different thread interleavings) can help catch tricky race conditions early. This is especially important in a
distributed system where reproducing bugs is difficult. The hyperkernel could also include an optional verification mode
where certain invariants are checked at runtime (using debug assertions or even formal verification tools that integrate
with Rust). The goal is a robust design that can push the limits of performance (leveraging multiple machines’
resources) without sacrificing the reliability of the unified system.

## Conclusion and Recommended Rust Components

Building “Big Iron” as an open-source distributed hyperkernel is an ambitious undertaking, but Rust’s ecosystem and
language features directly address many of the risks and complexities involved. By borrowing ideas from prior art (like
TidalScale’s HyperKernel, software DSM, and multi-kernel OS designs) and using modern Rust-based components, one can
create a system that **safely manages low-level resources** while scaling across nodes. Key recommendations and
components to consider include:

- **Leverage rust-vmm crates** for core virtualization functionality – they provide a solid, safe foundation for dealing
  with KVM, guest memory, and devices.
- **Adopt a distributed, cache-coherent memory model** for the cluster. Treat guest memory as an “all-cache” design and
  use Rust’s memory safety to enforce single-writer/multi-reader rules (e.g., via ownership transfer of pages). Use
  hardware page table virtualization and Rust’s concurrency primitives to maintain coherence (invalidating copies on
  writes, using COW for replicas).
- **Implement vCPU mobility** using KVM’s capabilities and Rust’s robust threading. Design vCPU state as a transferable
  unit (perhaps implementing traits like `Serialize` if needed) and use background threads or async tasks to handle the
  pack-and-send operations. This keeps CPUs near their needed memory and is essential for performance.
- **Utilize high-performance networking wisely**: start with simple solutions (e.g., Tokio with TCP sockets for
  simplicity and reliability), and profile the system. Only introduce DPDK or RDMA via Rust bindings if the standard
  stack becomes a bottleneck. If used, frameworks like Capsule can provide type-safe packet processing on DPDK, aligning
  with Rust’s ethos.
- **Prioritize safety but allow controlled unsafe**: encapsulate all unsafe code in well-audited modules (for low-level
  hardware interfacing). Use Rust’s `assert!` and debug checks liberally for critical invariants (e.g., “a page is not
  concurrently writable by two nodes”). Leverage community crates for tricky parts (for instance, use `crossbeam` for
  lock-free structures instead of writing your own).
- **Draw on existing projects**: Study Firecracker and Cloud Hypervisor for how they structure a VMM in Rust (event
  loops, device models, etc.), even though those focus on single-node virtualization. Also consider Rust-based OS
  projects (Redox OS, Theseus OS) for inspirations on memory management and state handling without compromise on safety.
  Each of these provides patterns on organizing large Rust codebases with low-level concerns.

In conclusion, Rust’s capabilities in systems programming make it an excellent choice for implementing a distributed
hyperkernel like Big Iron. By carefully combining low-level control (via KVM and hardware features) with high-level Rust
abstractions, one can build a system that **offers the performance of a cluster with the simplicity of a single machine
**, all while maintaining strong guarantees about memory safety and reliability. The result is a highly modular,
maintainable codebase – essentially, *Big Iron with Rust robustness*. The vision that “a bunch of cheap commodity
servers look like one big system with a flat memory space” is closer to reality with these modern tools at our disposal,
bringing the decades-old dream of software-only shared memory clusters to life in an open-source, safe manner.
