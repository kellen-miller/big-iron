# Project

The following is a basic project structure for the Rust implementation of the distributed hyperkernel. The layout
organizes the project into logical modules and components to keep the code maintainable and scalable.

## Description of the Main Components

1. main.rs
    - The entry point of the system that initializes the cluster and starts the hyperkernel process. This file would
      start the hyperkernel node, join the cluster, and load the OS kernel once resources are aggregated.
2. hyperkernel/
    - vcpu.rs: Responsible for managing virtual CPU state, scheduling, and migration between nodes.
    - memory.rs: Manages virtual memory, address translation, page fault handling, and memory coherence across nodes.
    - scheduler.rs: Handles the scheduling of vCPUs across nodes, migration policies, and load balancing.
    - io.rs: Implements device virtualization (disk, network devices), forwarding I/O requests to the appropriate
      physical node.
    - networking.rs: Handles low-level network communication, including RPC and custom messaging protocols to link
      nodes.
3. orchestration/
    - node_manager.rs: Manages the node lifecycle, including adding/removing nodes from the cluster and handling
      failures.
    - migration.rs: Orchestrates the live migration of vCPUs and memory pages across nodes, ensuring minimal disruption
      to the running system.
    - health_check.rs: Monitors the health of the nodes in the cluster, reporting failures and triggering recovery
      mechanisms.
4. storage/
    - block_device.rs: Manages virtual block devices that span multiple nodes, creating a distributed storage system.
    - file_system.rs: Provides abstractions for handling filesystems across the network, supporting remote storage (
      e.g., via networked file systems like NFS or distributed storage like Ceph).
5. communication/
    - rpc.rs: Implements the RPC mechanism to allow nodes to communicate commands, state updates, and data between each
      other.
    - message_queue.rs: A message queue system for task coordination, events, and communication between nodes, ensuring
      that the cluster operates in a synchronized fashion.
    - tcp.rs: Provides low-level TCP communication functionality for cluster nodes to send/receive memory and CPU data.
6. utils/
    - logger.rs: Implements a logging utility to trace events, memory accesses, migration steps, and node health in the
      system.

## Implementation and Development Phases:

- Phase 1: Set up the basic structure and implement a simple vCPU and memory management prototype. Start by implementing
  a basic single-node virtual CPU and memory allocation.
- Phase 2: Build out the scheduler for managing the execution of virtual CPUs across multiple nodes.
- Phase 3: Add support for basic memory fault handling and migration of pages across nodes using a simple memory
  coherence protocol.
- Phase 4: Implement the orchestration layer (node manager, health checks, node addition/removal).
- Phase 5: Integrate networking, RPC, and communication systems for multi-node coordination.
- Phase 6: Finalize storage management (block devices, file system handling) and test with multi-node configurations.
- Phase 7: Focus on optimization, adding machine learning algorithms for dynamic resource management, and tuning memory
  access locality.
